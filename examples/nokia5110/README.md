## Adafruit_GFX Arduino menu example for 5110 buffered display

This is a very simple menu with an example of how to use tcmenu with a monochrome Adafruit_GFX buffered display. It simulates a lighting control system.

The files that are in this example:

* `remoteControlSerial.cpp` & `.h` are generated by the menu designer, they should not be edited, include the header file whenever you want to work with the menu items.
* `remoteControlSerial.ino` is the sketch, it will be modified by the designer as needed to add call back functions and required start up code.
* `remoteControlSerial.emf` open in the designer UI, used by the designer to store the menu structure. It is not needed at runtime, only for loading the design into the designer.
* `SerialTransport.cpp` and `.h` is the actual serial transport plug in that is copied by tcmenu into your project, do not edit is overwritten at next code generation.
* `tcMenuLiquidCrystal.cpp` and `.h` is the actual plugin for the display, do not edit will be overwritten at next code generation.
