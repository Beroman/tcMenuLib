# TcMenu library for Arduino platform.

** NOTE, please continue to use TcMenu repo, this version is not yet ready for prime time **

TcMenu is a menu library for the Arduino platform, that supports different displays, remote control using a simple protocol over Ethernet and Serial, a 
Java API and rotary encoder or switch input. Target platform is anything from Arduino Uno upward. Tested on ATMEGA328 (Uno), Mega2560 and SAMD (MKR1300).

This is the Arduino library part of the package, it also comes with a Java designer and Java API. These are available from:

* [TcMenuAPI, Designer UI and Example UI]

## Package structure and installation:

Usually the best way to get started with tcMenu is to use the TcMenu designer, this is packaged for Windows and Mac, it is also available for
Linux.

If you are manually using tcMenu, without the designer, this page fully documents the types used, along with how to create them.

As this is more complex than most other Arduino libraries,
